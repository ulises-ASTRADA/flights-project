        "The AviationStack API was built to provide a simple way of accessing global aviation data for real-time and historical flights as well as allow customers to tap into an extensive data set of airline routes and other up-to-date aviation-related information. Requests to the REST API are made using a straightforward HTTP GET URL structure and responses are provided in lightweight JSON format. The objective of this project is to construct an ETL for a client in order to query information from the API, clean it, and store the results into a consumable database.\n",
